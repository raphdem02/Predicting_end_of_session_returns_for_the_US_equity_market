# US Equity Market and Data Challenge

The US equity market is renowned as one of the most liquid in the world, offering a plethora of investment opportunities. The most liquid period of the trading session occurs during the last two hours, from 2 pm to 4 pm.

## Ideal Time for Trading

These two hours are considered the ideal time for buying or selling a substantial quantity of assets due to improved market conditions, which include:

- Lower transaction costs
- Reduced volatility

Estimating the behavior of assets during this specific time frame in advance can greatly enhance the optimization of an entire investment portfolio.

## Data Challenge Background

We have selected this topic because it has practical applications for various stakeholders in the sector. In fact, this subject is being presented as part of a data challenge co-organized by two prestigious institutions:

- ENS (École Normale Supérieure)
- CFM (Capital Fund Management), one of France's largest hedge funds

## Challenge Objective

The primary objective of this challenge is to predict the direction of a stock's price movement during the last two hours of trading, based on its behavior at the start of the day.

To eliminate the typical noise associated with financial movements, we categorize the price movement into three distinct directions:

1. An outright drop in price
2. A minor change in either direction
3. A clear price rise
